# Factory Patten

## What is Factory Pattern?
Factory pattern is a creational-based design pattern. It let subclass to determine to create the the instance of the class.

## When to use Factory Pattern?
*. When you have multiple class which share the same characteristic ( eg: E-Sport, Hiking Sport, Hand Sport, Foot sport) but you want to initiate one those classes in a single class (which is sports)
*. When a class doesn't know what sub-classes will be required to create
*. When a class wants that its sub-classes specify the objects to be created.
*. When the parent classes choose the creation of objects to its sub-classes.

## Why do we need Factory Pattern?
*. Code standardization between subclasses
*. Easy code maintainance because code is not jumbled up)
*. Code become loosely coupled
*. Easy to add or remove sublcasses
